%%% This file is the preamble for the Pomona Linguistics Paper Template. 

%%% 

%For stacking text, used here in autosegmental diagrams
\usepackage{stackengine}

%To combine rows in tables
\usepackage{multirow}

%geometry helps manage margins, among other things.
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}

%used to draw the bullet below
\usepackage{graphicx}

%Gives some extra formatting options, e.g. underlining/strikeout
\usepackage{ulem}

%For putting links into papers, also helps make cross-references in the paper smart references
\usepackage[colorlinks = true,
            linkcolor = blue,
            urlcolor  = blue,
            citecolor = blue,
            anchorcolor = blue]{hyperref} %smarter cross-references, these options turn links blue

%Use package/command below to create a double-spaced document, if you want one. Uncomment BOTH the package and the command (\doublespacing) to create a doublespaced document, or leave them as is to have a single-spaced document.
%\usepackage{setspace}
%\doublespacing 
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,
columns=flexible,
breaklines=true
}
%paragraph formatting
\usepackage[parfill]{parskip}
\setlength{\parskip}{5pt} %plus 1 minus 1}
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}
\usepackage{titlesec}

%to position tables where I want
\usepackage{float}

%use for special OT tableaux symbols like bomb and sad face. must be loaded early on because it doesn't play well with some other packages
\usepackage{fourier-orns}

%Basic math symbols 
\usepackage{pifont}
\usepackage{amssymb}
%\usepackage{nath}

%%%Gives shortcuts for glossing. The use of this package is NOT explained in the Quick Reference Guide, but the documentation is on CTAN for those that are interested. MJKD finds it handy for glossing. (https://ctan.org/pkg/leipzig?lang=en)
\usepackage{leipzig}

%Tables
\usepackage{caption} %For table captions
\usepackage{booktabs} %helps format tables

%For citations and bibliography - as of 9.1.2019 we don't explain citations in this Quick Reference Guide, but Pedro Martin's tutorial does (see links in the Guide).
\usepackage{natbib}

%For OT-style tableaux
\usepackage[shadedcells]{ot-tableau}

%Fonts
%\usepackage[no-math]{fontspec} %This allows you to enter (via an IPA kayboard) IPA fonts and other symbols directly into LaTeX. Requires a particular setyp, see below.
%\usepackage{libertine} %A font that actually contains many IPA symbols. This is the font you see in the preview to the right.

%to use these fonts, be sure that your typesetting engine is set to "XeLaTeX." In Overleaf, go to the Menu link on the top left (by the Overleaf icon), and under Settings be sure that the Compiler is set to "XeLaTeX." If you accessed this document via the Overleaf Pomona Linguistics template, all of this was already done for you.

%The Pomona Linguistics Paper Template in Overleaf is already set up for this, but you may run into this problem if you start building your own documents.

%highlights text with \hl{text}
\usepackage{color, soul}

%Drawing Syntax Trees
%\usepackage[linguistics]{forest}

%This specifies some formatting for the forest trees to make them nicer to look at
%\forestset{
%  nice nodes/.style={
%    for tree={
%      inner sep=0pt,
%      fit=band,
%    },
%  },
%  default preamble=nice nodes,
%}

%These are useful for some of the details of arrows and other parts of syntax diagrams
%\usetikzlibrary{positioning} %I've included this for the sake of making figures!
%\usepackage{pstricks}
%\usepackage{pst-node}



%% For numbered and glossed examples %%
\usepackage{gb4e}



%Changes the \maketitle command to be smaller and take up less space on a page. 
\makeatletter         
\def\@maketitle{   % custom maketitle 
\noindent {\Large \bfseries \color{black} \@title}  \\ \hrule \noindent \@author \\ \@date  
}

%The code below will draw a circle around a piece of text. This is very useful for drawing attention to a word in a data example. use the command \circled{text} where the argument (`text' here) is what you want to be circled. This is illustrated in the Quick Reference Guide and the Paper Template. We do not know the provenance of this handy command so if the person who wrote this wants credit just let us know.

%\usepackage{tikz}

%\newcommand{\circled}[1]{\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(word.base)]
%\node[draw, rounded corners, text height=8pt, text depth=2pt, inner sep=2pt, outer sep=0pt, use as bounding box] (word) {#1};
%\end{tikzpicture}
%}

% Useful Ling Shortcuts

%\RequirePackage{mathtools} % for \mathrlap

\RequirePackage{xspace}

\newcommand{\type}[1]{\ensuremath{\langle{#1}\rangle}}% Type brackets for type-theory 	 ... \type{e,\type{s,t}}, from linguistics package			
\newcommand{\nl}{\ensuremath{\varnothing}}	  % =null; Null symbol ... \nl  (\null is already used) % Requires amssymb package, or a class that calls it %From Linguistics package

%This creates the command \bigcdot which is nice as a bullet for the conventional implicature formalism. Adapted from here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/235118/making-a-thicker-cdot-for-dot-product-that-is-thinner-than-bullet

%A couple of packages that seemed to prefer being called toward the end of the preamble

%The packages and tikz libraries below are used to generate the arrows on forest trees and linear diagrams that are explained in our Arrows explainer. https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/arrows-for-syntax-diagrams-with-forest/xjyvcszgcspv

%\usetikzlibrary{positioning} %does something for the positioning of arrows and I can't remember what
%\usetikzlibrary{arrows,arrows.meta} %gives extra details for arrows (specifically, the tips of arrows)
